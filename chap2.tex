\chapter{Background and Related Work}
\label{chap:background}

% The goal of this chapter is for laying the technical background (such as distributed source coding) for understanding the contribution of your thesis; non-technical background (such as the background of M2M communications) can go to Chapter~\ref{chap:introduction}.

Related work should be be classified into proper sub-sections depending on the topics
related to your thesis research.
\section{LEO satellite network}

\subsection{Quasi-Earth-Fixed cell}

The quasi-Earth-fixed cell is a new non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) satellite beam technique compared to earth-moving cell. Unlike the earth-moving cell that the coverage area of the satellite beam changes when the LEO satellite is moving, the quasi-earth-fixed cell adjusts the beam direction so that the coverage area remains the same in a certain period.
